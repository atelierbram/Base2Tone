Base2Tone is based on [DuoTone themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes) by [Simurai](http://simurai.com/) for Atom.

> It <strong>tones down</strong> less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the <strong>important</strong> ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff youâ€™re looking for.

Use these colorschemes to generate syntax-highlighting themes (TODO: _for many applications_):

[Prism](https://github.com/atelierbram/Base2Tone-prism)
[Vim](https://github.com/atelierbram/Base2Tone-vim)
[iTerm2](https://github.com/atelierbram/Base2Tone-iterm2)
[Markdown (color-value tables](https://github.com/atelierbram/Base2Tone-markdown)

### Dependencies
 Some customized commands from the latest fork of Base16 Builder can be found here in an executable bash script (`io.sh`). Read more on this versatile and flexible <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> building tool [on the Github repo for Base16 Builder](https://github.com/base16-builder/base16-builder), and the many ways to use it from the command-line.

Base16 Builder is available on NPM<sup>[1]</sup>, you can install it on your machine like so from the commandline:

```
$ npm install --global base16-builder
```

### Create your own colorscheme.
The schemes and templates used can be found in the `db` folder, from other repos here on Github, for example [Base2Tone-prism](https://github.com/atelierbram/Base2Tone-prism). Copy and edit one of them `schemes/colorschemes.yml` from 32 color-value variables, (_maybe start by editing the demo-tile colors in the demo_) and build your own Base2Tone Prism theme. Make a pull request if you would like to see it here in amongst these colorschemes. More conversions for other applications will follow, [see also here](http://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/duotones/).

### Conversions
The light version of the Morning theme, and dark versions of Evening, Sea, Space, Earth and Forest were converted from [DuoTone Themes for Atom](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes) by [Simurai](http//simurai.com). Morning and Evening are the default Duotone Light and Duotone Dark schemes, but renamed here in order to have a consistent naming convention.
